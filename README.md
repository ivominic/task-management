# First nest.js project

## Dependency injection

Dependency injection is done through controllers class constructor. After that, service is available inside that class/controller.

## DTO - data transfer object

DTO is class that stores information about data types for properties passed to another function/api/procedure. Allows to change property type at one place and changes will be propagated. DTO can be created for each model, in dto subfolder.

## Validation and error handling

To use pipes for validation, validator and transformer package needs to be installed. It is done with command:
npm install class-validator class-transformer --save
After that, validators and pipes are used like decorators over properties and methods.

# development
